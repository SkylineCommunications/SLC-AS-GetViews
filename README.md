# SLC-AS-GetViews

This script will ask for one script parameter:

- RootView: Name of the view for which the subviews will be returned.

## Logic

The script will log in information events a list of views that are directly under the specified root view. The name and ID of the view are logged.

## Future Implementation Ideas
